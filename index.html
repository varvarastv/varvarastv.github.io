      <h5 class="card-title">Personal Life</h5>
      <p>After moving to Athens he lived with an older English woman named Sally, with whom he had begun a relationship on Corfu.[13] Their relationship ended when Psinakis became Rouvas' manager, and the singer became more career-oriented. The media has speculated about Rouvas' personal life and relationships with model Zeta Logotheti, Sofi Kantarou (a Corfu bar manager) and singer Elli Kokkinou.[255] At this time, Rouvas became more reclusive and guarded about his personal life.[4]

In 2003 he was in a relationship with the London based Taiwanese producer Rebecca Wang.[264]

Rouvas met model Katia Zygouli back in 2003 during the shootings of a commercial ad for Vodafone and the two of them became a couple. They kept their relationship away from the media despite the rumors and Rouvas first confirmed their relationship during a radio interview to Natalia Germanou.[265][266]

In June 2008, Rouvas announced Zygouli's pregnancy[267] and on 2 November 2008, Zygouli gave birth to the couple's first child,[268][269] a daughter named Anastasia after her father on 18 October 2009. Her godmother was Emmanouela Pavlatou, a friend of Melina Mercouri, and the baptismal date was chosen to coincide with Mercouri's birthday.[270][271] Anastasia's birth was extensively covered by the media.[265] On 15 October 2011, Rouvas and Zygouli became parents for the second time to a son, named Alexandros.[272] The couple's third child and second daughter, named Ariadni, arrived on 3 January 2013.[273][274] The couple welcomed their fourth child, on 21 April 2016.[275] On Monday 3 July 2017, Sakis Rouvas married Katia Zygouli.

      <h5 class="card-title">Additional Information</h5>
      <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Politician causes</h6>
      <p>Rouvas has spoken out against LGBT discrimination, and in favor of the adoption of children by gay couples.[276]

In July 2015 Rouvas uploaded a video message titled "Yes we are Europe" on his personal YouTube channel, in which he supported the pro-Europe vote for the 2015 Greek bailout referendum.

On Twitter, he follows the accounts of politicians across the board from far-left to far-right, and party leaders Alexis Tsipras and Antonis Samaras, to have a full picture of what they are saying and how political leaders are confronting each other. He also followed a Golden Dawn MP at some point. This led him to be referenced by a Syriza MP, Pavlos Polakis, in a speech in the Greek Parliament, suggesting that he had supported the party. Rouvas sent a Cease and desist letter to Polakis asking to retract his statement or the matter would be dealt with in court.

      <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Controversies</h6>
      <p>When he was called for military service in 1994 he asked for a delay, since his service would coincide with the release of Aima, Dakrya & Idrotas; the request was denied,[4][255] although other artists had been able to delay their service for career reasons.[255] Although it was initially thought that Rouvas did not want to leave the spotlight when his career was growing, he claimed his reluctance to serve was due to agoraphobia.[4][255] His claims were met with astonishment; media outlets remarked that agoraphobia was an odd condition for an entertainer,[4] and critics accused him of draft dodging.[4] The singer was taken to the Penteli psychiatric hospital for an evaluation, and it was widely reported that he had attempted suicide.[4][255] After his release Rouvas fulfilled his military service.[4][255] During his service, he was pestered by paparazzi.[4][255] Psinakis accused Rouvas' psychiatrist of pouring psychotropic drugs into Rouvas' alcoholic beverages because of a previous quarrel.[4][255] When asked if he was suicidal Rouvas said he did not think so, but he was so drugged at the time of the emergency call that he did not recall the exact events; he confirmed that he tried to desert by climbing under a Jeep and attaching himself to its undercarriage.[284][285]

On 19 May 1997, Rouvas performed with Turkish singer Burak Kut at a bi-national reconciliation concert on the Green Line in Cyprus before an audience of over 4,000.[286] The concert received international coverage and support, earning Rouvas an International Abdi Ipekçi Prize for global understanding and co-operation;[287][288] however, the concert was controversial to Greek and Turkish protesters, and stones, eggs and tomatoes were thrown at the singer in all his next concerts.[289] Opposition to the concert turned the Greek and Greek-Cypriot media against Rouvas,[286] and was fodder for tabloid talk shows in Greece.[290] Rouvas left Greece and moved to the United States for six months for the incident to be forgotten.[290]

During summer 2000[4] Rouvas, Psinakis and a number of other celebrities visited Mykonos on a yacht borrowed from a local physician.[4][255] They were accused of drug possession, since the yacht contained narcotics.[4][255] Although the doctor admitted that the narcotics were his, his guests were questioned.[4][255] However, thousands of T-shirts were printed which read: "Imoun ki ego sto kotero!" ("I was on the yacht, too!").[4][255][291]

He collaborated with Pepsi in 2001, the advertisement, featuring a semi-nude Rouvas holding a Pepsi bottle in front of his genitals, was controversial among women's rights and parental associations. Calling it "unsightly, vulgar and unacceptable", they tried to have the ad blocked as "disgrac[ing] childhood innocence and dignity."

      <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Eurovision</h6>
      <p>In March 2004, Hellenic Radio and Television (ERT) announced that Rouvas would represent Greece in the Eurovision Song Contest 2004 after the selection process on the reality show EuroStar proved unsatisfactory.[41][42] The show's winner was expected to represent Greece, with Nikos Terzis writing the song entry;[43] however, ERT changed its plans when the winner's ability to perform under so much pressure was questionable and Rouvas expressed an interest in representing his country.[44] In mid-March "Shake It", with music by Terzis and lyrics by Nektarios Tyrakis, premiered on Greek radio. Originally, the song had Latin spirit and sound but Terzis changed it, combining the Greek traditional bouzouki sound with the Latin one to make it sound different from other Latin entries of the competition.[45] At the third Arion Music Awards, he won Best Pop Singer for To Hrono Stamatao.[46] In mid-April "Shake It" was released as a CD single, and Rouvas began a promotional tour of Europe for the contest;[47] To Hrono Stamatao was reissued with a bonus "Shake It" single. The song remained number one on the Greek airplay charts for several weeks, and was number one on the IFPI Greece Top 50 singles chart for nine consecutive weeks. 
      	Rouvas was favored to win the Eurovision final.[49] On 12 May 2004 he performed in the semi-final (appearing 10th out of 22), and performed 16th out of 24 in the 15 May 2004 final. Rouvas had two female dancers and three backing vocalists: the EuroStar winner and runners-up. Fokas Evangelinos, Rouvas' longtime choreographer, choreographed his stage show.[41] "Shake It" finished third in the final,[50] with Rouvas attracting great interest in the contest by Greek viewers (with a rating of 86.7 percent, the highest rating in Greek TV history at the time).[51] Rouvas' appearance in Eurovision was a turning point in his career; his public perception changed from media-produced celebrity to notable pop artist, and he became more accessible to the media.[52]

In June 2004, Rouvas performed "Shake It" at the first MAD Video Music Awards, where he won Sexiest Appearance for the "Pes Tis" ("Tell Her") music video.[53] On 7 July, Rouvas performed in Istanbul with Turkish artist (and 2003 Eurovision Song Contest winner) Sertab Erener in another attempt to maintain peace between the two countries.[54] In August he carried the Olympic torch through Panathinaiko Stadium[55][56] and performed at the closing ceremony for the 2004 Summer Olympics, in which he was lowered to the stage from the air and sang a traditional Greek song, "Karapiperim".[57]

In fall 2004, Rouvas recorded a duet version of "Se Thelo San Trelos" ("I Want You Like Crazy", from 21os Akatallilos) with Russian pop singer Philip Kirkorov.[58] In December he began performing with Giorgos Mazonakis at Fever for the winter season, with Elena Paparizou as their opening act.[59][60] His show was praised; Georgia Laimou of E-go, known for scathing reviews, wrote: "I have only good things to say about Sakis and I don't want to hear 'boo' from anyone. I don't think that a more neat, well-supported, professional, and generally flawless performance than Sakis' exists on the Athenian clubs."[61]

On 6 April 2005 Rouvas released his tenth album, S'eho Erotefthi (I'm in Love With You), which went platinum in five months and was eventually certified 3× platinum.[62] With Vodafone Greece as their main sponsor, release parties for the CD were held in Heraklion, Corfu, Thessaloniki, and Athens on the same day and "S'eho Erotefti", "Hilia Milia" ("A Thousand Miles"), "Mila Tis" ("Talk to Her"), "Na M' Agapas" ("You Should Love Me") and "Cairo" became radio hits.[14] That year, Rouvas won the World Music Award as Best-Selling Greek Artist of 2004.[63] In September he gave a charity concert at the Olympic Indoor Hall for an audience of 20,000 (the largest production by any Greek entertainer until Rouvas surpassed the record in 2009), followed by a concert in Patras.
